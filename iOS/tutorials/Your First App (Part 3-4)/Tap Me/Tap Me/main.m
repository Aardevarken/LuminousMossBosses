///  UIApplication serves as the central brain of your app. It gives you a

///  While command-line applications will have more code in main.m, iOS apps
///	 just need to boot up UIApplication and hand off control.

///	 In 99.99% of the iOS apps youâ€™ll encounter as a developer, you never need
///	 to edit main.m; therefore it is stored away in the Supporting Files folder.
