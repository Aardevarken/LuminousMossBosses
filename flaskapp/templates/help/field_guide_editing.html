Access is strictly controlled since people with access can make changes to data (but almost never delete data). New accounts created via signup on that page will need approval before they can access anything.

The first 661 observations were imported by us in order to train our first detection algorithm. All others come from phones. The User ID column is a unique name given to each installation of the mobile app. The far right column allows admins, subadmins, and developers to verify an observation as silene or not. The tabs at the top allow filtering by verification. In particular, the unconfirmed tab is useful for viewing new observations just uploaded by phones. Clicking the filename will open up a more detailed view of the observation, with location, accuracy, and date information. Additionally, at the bottom is a select box called &ldquo;Use Image For&rdquo; allowing you to include the image from that observation in the training or testing set.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c6"><a name="h.psimltj1gj46"></a><span>CSV</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Observations can be downloaded at </span><span class="c8"><a class="c4" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fluminousid.com%2Fcsv&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsfWmetJ4nO0c01RgZfCoAnHlFjA">http://luminousid.com/csv</a></span><span>&nbsp;or CSV Download in the menu to the left</span><span>.
