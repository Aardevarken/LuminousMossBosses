Proof of concept Bag of Words / Bag of Features Silene Identifier

Requires exactly version 2.4.9 of OpenCV: https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/tree/2.4.9.x-prep
Unfortunately it is also dependent on the nonfree opencv module, which ubuntu refuses to ship, so I had to compile it from source.
For ubuntu, I found these build instructions to work well: http://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/

To generate your own xml files:
make build_vocab
./build_vocab positivedir negativedir
make bow_train
./bow_train positivedir negativedir

To use xml files:
make bow
./bow imagepath.jpg

Output is a number of unknown significance, but has a high correlation with if it is a silene or not.
Running it on my images, a value over 0.84 is likely not silene, a value over 1 is never silene.
Good silene detections are usually in the 0.6-0.8 range.
